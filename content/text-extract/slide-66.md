KEDA
Event-driven autoscaling - scale on external metrics, queues, and events
KEDA is a Kubernetes add on that helps scale applications based on real-world events
KEDA can adjust the size & number of your containers automatically, depending on the workload like the number of messages in a queue or incoming requests.
Works alongside Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
Over 80 different ‘scalers’ available, each providing a different source of events to base scaling rules on
